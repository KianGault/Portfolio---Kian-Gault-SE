# Workflow 
## Task workflow

As a team, we have decided to use the Github flow. 

To do this we have a project board and our list of issues for the week. We imported this from the template and uploaded each issue
to the to-do section of our board. 

<ins> To do section of our project board <ins>

After this was achieved we all selected an issue to work on. 

<ins> my chosen issue moved to the in progress tab <ins>

As you can see in the image i selected the issue to add the data of values of roles 
to the database. 

To show this to my team i assigned myself to the issue and moved the issue from 
the to-do section to the in progress section. 

To begin work on my own issue i had to create a new branch so i wouldn't conflict 
our main app branch. 

To do this i simply changed my targeted remote from main to a new branch i called
"Kian's branch".

<ins> my created branch on GitHub <ins>

Having this branch allows me to make changes to our app without changing the 
main branch app so if anything was to go wrong only my branch will be effected.

<ins> completing the issue <ins> 

Due to development issues in our team we were unable to get a working main 
application in time of our set deadline so we weren't able to implement our own
branches to finish our issues. 

The logic side of finishing our issues were discussed at length for future 
development but first we have to get the main branch working before we can 
implement feature branches. 

To finish this issue i would simply need to make a new data class in our app
and change the base map of the variables to match my own issues data. This 
will hopefully be added to our main branch in due time. 

## Reflection

This week was the first time our team came across issues in our communication. 
We all seemed lost on what was needed to be done and planning meetings became
a challenge. 

A method we have decided to fix this issue is during our next stand up meeting 
we are going to identify each members strengths and weaknesses. This will help 
us allocate issues to the best choice so no one is out of their depth. 

We have also discussed the possibility of a planned a second stand up meeting later 
in the week so no one is left stuck for long.
